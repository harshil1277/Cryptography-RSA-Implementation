# RSA Algorithm Insecurities and Padding

The RSA algorithm, while powerful, has certain vulnerabilities that can be exploited if not properly addressed. This document discusses some of these vulnerabilities and how padding, particularly Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP), can resolve them.

## RSA Algorithm Insecurities

1. **Deterministic Encryption**: Without padding, RSA encryption is deterministic, making it vulnerable to attacks such as chosen plaintext attacks and frequency analysis.

2. **Malleability**: Textbook RSA encryption is malleable, allowing attackers to manipulate the ciphertext without knowledge of the plaintext.

## Padding in RSA Encryption

Padding schemes like OAEP address these vulnerabilities by introducing randomness and structure to the plaintext before encryption. OAEP padding involves steps such as adding randomness, error detection, and conversion to an integer before encryption.

By incorporating padding schemes like OAEP, the security of RSA encryption is significantly enhanced, making it more resistant to various cryptographic attacks.

For implementation details, refer to the code snippets provided below.

## Code Snippets

```python
# Python code implementing RSA encryption with OAEP padding

from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa, padding

# Generate public and private keys first 

# Encrypt plaintext with the public key
# Encrypts the plaintext using the public key with OAEP padding using SHA256 hash algorithm.
ciphertext = public_key.encrypt(
    plaintext,
    padding.OAEP(
        mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()),
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        label=None
    )
)

# Decrypt ciphertext with the private key
plaintext = private_key.decrypt(
    ciphertext,
    padding.OAEP(
        mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()),
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        label=None
    )
)
```
